# Motivation
My wife and I are what I consider regular homebodies. We enjoy our time together and love hanging out at home in the evenings. Like most people we get too caught up browsing through movies on Netflix, HBO, Disney+, and all of the other streaming services out there. Along with that, we spend way too long searching through the endless recipes on Pinterest trying to find something to make. This app has solved this problem and has saved us quality time during our nights in together.
